    <p><strong>Where are we located?</strong>
The easiest way to find us is to proceed on US 1 until arriving at Fifth Street. There is a Yamaha Motorcycle dealership on the corner. We are located in the middle of the block after making your turn onto Fifth Street.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p><strong>Where do I park?</strong>
Parking is available in the church's front paved and side grass lots. Parking is also available behind the church in our off-street lot. Street parking is also available. There are guest spots located in the front lot and handicapped spots located in the side lot.</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p><strong>Where do I enter?</strong> The main entrance is in the front of the church. Those parking in the rear lot may enter in through the double doors marked "Fellowship Hall", proceed to the right and follow the hallway to gain access to the sanctuary.  There is handicapped ramp access available through this rear lot entrance as well.</p>
        
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
        <p><strong>What should I wear? </strong>Our members and friends dress differently. Some wear dresses and suits while others dress casually. One is free to dress in the attire they are most comfortable in. Our only request is that modesty in dress be exercised.  </p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class=col-md-4>
        <p><strong>What should I bring with me?</strong> We encourage our members and friends to bring a copy of God's Word whether digital or print versions. Although any translation is acceptable our messages are preached from the NIV Bible. NAS Bibles are available in the pews. Scripture passages are also projected on the wall via our AV system during the morning service. Appropriate items for baby (diapers, formula as needed) are also encouraged. If not using your electronic equipment for bible access we encourage you to silence it.    </p>
        
        
        </div>
        <div class=col-md-4>
        <p><strong>Where do I take my children? </strong> Nursery and toddler rooms are located in the hallway located behind Fellowship Hall. Our membership is instructed to help you find the rooms age-appropriate for your child. Older children will join their parents in the sanctuary until dismissed for Children's Church at an announced time. All of our children's and youth workers are required to go through extensive background checks before working with these age groups. </p>

        <div class=col-md-4>
        <p><strong>What time do services start?</strong> Fifth Street begins its morning service with Bible Study for all ages at 9:45. The service itself starts at 11am. Our music features a blend of traditional and contemporary and our services normally last anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes depending on the worship schedule that morning.</p>

        <p><strong>How are guests recognized?</strong> First-time guests are provided with a "Guest Packet" with church information and a card which may be voluntarily filled out to provide us with a record of your visit. During our greeting time we also voluntarily ask first-time guests to remain seated so our members and friends can more readily greet you with a warm welcome. You will not be asked to raise a hand or do anything that might embarrass you.</p>
        
        
        </div>
        <div class=col-md-6>
        <p><strong>Am I expected to give?</strong> Absolutely not. We only ask of guests to drop their filled-out guest cards into the offering plates. However if you feel led to do so we would be encouraged by your financial support of our ministry.</p>
